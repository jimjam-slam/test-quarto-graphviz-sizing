title: "GraphViz sizing test"
---

Here's an R plot chunk. It's wrapped in `.quarto-figure`, which means that its enclosing figure gets `width: 100%`:

```{r}
hist(c(3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 8, 3, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 4, 1))
```

Now here's a GraphViz chunk. It doesn't have a `.quarto-figure` wrapper, and it has `max-width: none` set inline:

```{dot}
graph G {
  layout=neato
  run -- intr;
  intr -- runbl;
}
```
